# Early Repayment Options {#early-repayment-options}

> Debt instruments could have early repayment options to repay the principal to
> investors (partially or totally) before maturity.

If the debt instrument has early repayment options, the D-ASA **MUST** implement
the **OPTIONAL** `set_early_repayment_time_events` and `early_repayment` methods.

The early repayment options **MAY** repay the *principal* partially or totally.

The early repayment options **MAY** repay the *principal* to all or some Lenders.

In the case of an on-chain payment agent, the D-ASA **MUST** repay the *principal*
to the Lander Payment Addresses.

In case of early repayment options, the D-ASA units associated with the early repaid
principal **MUST** be removed from Lendersâ€™ Accounts and circulation.

> The implementation **SHOULD** manage:
>
> - The callability options;
> - The accrued interest.

> ðŸ“Ž **EXAMPLE**
>
> Letâ€™s have a D-ASA denominated in EUR, with a *principal* of 1M EUR and a *minimum
> denomination* of 1,000 EUR. The D-ASA originally had 1,000 *total units* in circulation.
> An early repayment of 500k EUR (equal to 500 units) is executed for some Lenders.
> The D-ASA now has 500 circulating units (worth 1,000 EUR each), while 500 early
> repaid units are removed from circulation.

## Early Repayment Schedule

If the D-ASA has early repayment options, it **MUST** define *early repayment
time events* as `uint64[]` array, where:

- The length of the array **MUST** be `N>=2`;

- The first element **MUST** be the *early repayment start date* (`uint64`): the
time after which early repayment options could be executed;

- The last element **MUST** be the *early repayment end date* (`uint64`): the time
after which early repayment options cannot be executed.

The *early repayment time events* **MUST** be sorted in strictly ascending order.

The *early repayment start date* **MUST NOT** be earlier than the *issuance date*.

The *early repayment end date* **MUST NOT** be later than the *maturity date*.

The *early repayment time events* **SHOULD** be defined as UNIX time, in seconds.

If *early repayment time events* are defined in UNIX time with non-continuous *day-count
conventions* (ID<`255`), the *time periods* between subsequent events **MUST**
be multiples of a day, in seconds.

The *early repayment time events* **MUST** be set with the `set_early_repayment_time_events`
method.

The *early repayment time events* **MAY** be updated with the `set_early_repayment_time_events`
method.

The updated *early repayment time events* **MUST NOT** modify past events.
