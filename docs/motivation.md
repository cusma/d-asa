Debt instruments represent one of the biggest asset classes (along with equities,
commodities, and real estate). Debt instruments are investment contracts between
borrowers and lenders, used to raise capital with binding obligations between the
parties, who agree on the payoff and the cash flows (payments schedule, interest
rates, maturity, etc.).

The definition of a comprehensive specification for the tokenization of debt instruments
benefits several players of the traditional value chain, such as issuers, arrangers,
asset managers, lenders, payment agents, and transfer agents, etc.

The *Debt Algorand Standard Application* turns a traditional debt instrument into
a deterministic contract, executed on the Algorand Virtual Machine (AVM). The machine-readable
and executable contract removes existing frictions over the debt instruments lifecycle
and reconciliation, enabling use cases such as truly atomic delivery-vs-payment
(with instant finality), deterministic cash flows analysis (when, how much, to whom),
and easier quantitative risk management.
