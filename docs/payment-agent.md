# Payment Agent {#payment-agent}

> Debt instruments' cash flows depend on the payoff, they usually involve:
>
> - *Principal repayment;*
> - *Early repayment options;*
> - *Coupon payments.*

> D-ASA supports both on-chain and off-chain payment agents, depending on the settlement
> asset (see [Settlement](./settlement.md) section).

The D-ASA payment methods **MAY** provide additional information about the payment.

> The payment information could be used to add a unique identifier or external context
> to the payments, enabling external payment system integration in the case of off-chain
> payment agents.
