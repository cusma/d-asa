# Regulations {#regulations}

> Debt instruments are regulated under different legal frameworks and their jurisdictions.

> The D-ASA ensures efficient execution of the debt instrument in the "best case
> scenarios", where it offers the highest improvements on cost and time efficiency
> if compared to the traditional, manual, and labor-intensive contracts.

> The D-ASA provides methods to comply with regulatory obligations, allowing the
> management of the "worst case scenarios", in which the intervention of the authority
> or the regulator is necessary.

## Suspension {#suspension}

> Debt instruments can be temporarily suspended due to regulations or operational
> reasons.

### Asset Suspension

The D-ASA **MAY** suspend all:

- Payments;
- D-ASA units transfers.

The asset *suspension* status **MUST** be set with the `set_asset_suspension_status`
method.

### Account Suspension

The D-ASA **MAY** suspend account:

- Payments (skipped on due dates);
- D-ASA units transfers (from and to).

The account *suspension* status **MUST** be set with the `set_account_suspension_status`
method.

## Default {#default}

> Debt instruments are exposed to default risks.

> Default is the failure to pay the lenders according to the payment obligations.

> Default processes require the intervention of regulatory bodies and courts, therefore
> the D-ASA default status bridges the default process off-chain.

The D-ASA **SHOULD** enter *default* status if it cannot perform payments on due
dates.

The D-ASA **MAY** disable all non-administrative methods on *default* status.

> The D-ASA default can be called either automatically (based on program conditions)
> or manually (based on the decision of a trustee).

The *default* status **MAY** be set with the **OPTIONAL** `set_default_status` method.

> ðŸ“Ž **EXAMPLE**
>
> A D-ASA coupon payment is triggered on due date, but there is not enough liquidity
> to pay all the investors. The D-ASA contract automatically enters in default immediately.

> ðŸ“Ž **EXAMPLE**
>
> A D-ASA coupon payment is triggered on due date, but there is not enough liquidity
> to pay all the investors. The D-ASA program increments a failed payments counter
> and waits 3 hours to retry. If the D-ASA has three failed payments in a row, then
> the contract automatically enters in default.

> ðŸ“Ž **EXAMPLE**
>
> A D-ASA coupon payment is triggered on due date, but there is not enough liquidity
> to pay all the investors. The D-ASA contract relies on a trustee to call the default.
